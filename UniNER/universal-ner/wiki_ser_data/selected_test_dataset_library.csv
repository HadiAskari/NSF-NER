"IBM introduced the IBM 3310 Direct Access Storage Device on January 30 , 1979 , for IBM 4331 midrange computers . The 3310 was a fixed-block architecture device , used on DOS/VSE and VM , the only S/370 operating systems that supported FBA devices . The IBM 3330 Direct Access Storage Facility , code-named Merlin , was introduced in June 1970 for use with the IBM System/370 and the IBM System 360/195 . Its removable disk packs hold 100MB ( 404×19× 13,030 bytes ) . A major advance introduced with the 3330 was the use of error correction , which makes the drives more reliable and reduced costs because small imperfections in the disk surface can be tolerated . The 1973 3330 Model 11 features IBM 3336-11 Disk Packs that held up to 200MB ( 808x19x 13,030 bytes ) . Up to three additional 3330 type DASD ( six drives ) can then be attached to a 3333 .",[],[]

The SIGHUP signal is sent to a process when its controlling terminal is closed . It was originally designed to notify the process of a serial line drop ( a hangup ) . In modern systems , this signal usually means that the controlling pseudo or virtual terminal has been closed . Many daemons ( who have no controlling terminal ) interpret receipt of this signal as a request to reload their configuration files and flush/reopen their logfiles instead of exiting .",[],[]

"CONFIG.SYS is the primary configuration file for the DOS and OS/2 operating systems . It is a special ASCII text file that contains user-accessible setup or configuration directives evaluated by the operating system 's DOS BIOS ( typically residing in IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS ) during boot . CONFIG.SYS was introduced with DOS 2.0 . The directives in this file configure DOS for use with devices and applications in the system . After processing the CONFIG.SYS file , DOS proceeds to load and execute the command shell specified in the SHELL line of CONFIG.SYS , or COMMAND.COM if there is no such line . In fact , these will either define some tunable parameters often resulting in reservation of memory , or load files , mostly device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programs ( TSRs ) , into memory . In DOS , CONFIG.SYS is located in the root directory of the drive from which the system was booted . The filename is also used by ( DCP ) , an MS-DOS derivative by the former East-German VEB Robotron . Some versions of DOS will probe for alternative filenames taking precedence over the default CONFIG.SYS filename if they exist : While older versions of Concurrent DOS 3.2 to 4.1 did not support CONFIG.SYS files at all , later versions of Concurrent DOS 386 and Concurrent DOS XM , as well as Multiuser DOS , System Manager and REAL/32 will probe for CCONFIG.SYS ( with "" C "" derived from "" Concurrent "" ) instead of CONFIG.SYS . Some versions of MultiuserDOS use a filename of CCONFIG.INI instead , whereas REAL/32 is known to look for MCONFIG.SYS . These operating systems support many additional and different configuration settings ( like INIT_INSTALL ) not known under MS-DOS/PCDOS , but they are stored in the binary repository named CCONFIG.BIN rather than in CCONFIG.INI . Since DRDOS6.0 this was used in conjunction with disk compression software , where the original boot driveC : would become driveD : after loading the compression driver ( and the "" D "" in the file name came in handy as well ) , but it is commonly used to help maintain multiple configuration files in multi-boot scenarios . For example , with SYS /L /DR:703 the written Volume Boot Record would look for a renamed and modified IBMBIO.703 system file ( instead of the default IBMBIO.COM ) and the IBMBIO.703 would look for IBMDOS.703 and [D]CONFIG.703 ( instead of IBMDOS.COM and [D]CONFIG.SYS ) , so that multiple parallel sets of files can coexist in the same root directory and be selected via a boot-loader like LOADER , supplied with Multiuser DOS and DR-DOS 7.02/7.03 . The SHELL directive is enhanced to provide means to specify alternative AUTOEXEC.BAT files via /P[:filename.ext] and in this specific scenario , COMMAND.COM will accept file extensions other than "" .BAT "" as well ( both features are also supported by 4DOS ) . Under DRDOS6.0 and higher , the CONFIG.SYS directive CHAIN = filespec can be used to continue processing in the named file , which does not necessarily need to reside in the root directory of the boot drive . DR-DOS 7.03 and higher support a new SYS /A parameter in order to copy the corresponding CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files along with the system files . FreeDOS implements a similar feature with its FDCONFIG.SYS configuration file . PTS-DOS uses CONFIG.PTS . Both CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT can be found included in the root folder of Windows 95 , and Windows 98 boot drives , as they are based on DOS . Windows ME does not even parse the CONFIG.SYS file during the Windows boot process , loading environment variables from the Windows Registry instead : Under FlexOS , CONFIG.SYS is a binary file defining the resource managers and device drivers loaded . ( Under MS-DOS/PCDOS the inline-comment is not ignored if put in double-quotes . ) ( FreeDOS does not support optional messages , but optional conditions in conjunction with boot menus defined with and . ) ( DOS 6.0 and higher supports a similar feature by adding a after the corresponding CONFIG.SYS directive , f.e. Configures which drives should store file access date stamps in the reserved area of directory entries in FAT file systems . Changes internal default serial device driver ( to ) for device . Loads base device driver into memory . Specifies operating system to be booted . Same as , but explicitly loads buffers into HMA or UMB ( like under DR DOS 6.0 and higher ) . Similar to under DOS , loads programs in CONFIG.SYS . Similar to under OS/2 , but runs in foreground and halts CONFIG.SYS processing until return . Specifies the name of the CD-ROM hardware driver . Continues CONFIG.SYS processing in new file and ( since DR-DOS 7.02 ) at optional label . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM1 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM2 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM3 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM4 : device . Loads a device driver into memory . Loads a device driver into upper memory . Configures country and codepage information for KBD , SCR , LPT1 , LPT2 , LPT3 devices . Specifies whether to load DOS into the high memory area and/or use upper memory . Specifies whether to load DOS tables ( , , , , ) into upper memory . Specifies alternative path to search for DOS files . Works considerably differently from the external MS-DOS/PCDOS FASTOPEN driver . Specifies the number of cached FCBs that can be opened at once .

The LC 500 series included four main models , the 520 , 550 , 575 , and 580 , with the 520 and 550 both using different speeds of the Motorola 68030 , and the 575 and 580 sharing the 33 MHz Motorola 68LC040 processor but differing on the rest of the hardware . All of these computers were also sold to the consumer market through department stores under the Macintosh Performa brand , with similar model numbers . The LC models , in particular , became very popular in schools for their small footprint , lack of cable clutter , and durability . The Macintosh TV , while not branded as an LC , uses the LC 520 's case ( in black instead of beige ) and a logic board similar to the LC 550 . The compact Color Classic series shares many components , and is able to swap logic boards with the early 500 series machines . The Macintosh LC 520 was introduced in June 1993 .

"CONFIG.SYS is the primary configuration file for the DOS and OS/2 operating systems . It is a special ASCII text file that contains user-accessible setup or configuration directives evaluated by the operating system 's DOS BIOS ( typically residing in IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS ) during boot . CONFIG.SYS was introduced with DOS 2.0 . The directives in this file configure DOS for use with devices and applications in the system . After processing the CONFIG.SYS file , DOS proceeds to load and execute the command shell specified in the SHELL line of CONFIG.SYS , or COMMAND.COM if there is no such line . In fact , these will either define some tunable parameters often resulting in reservation of memory , or load files , mostly device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programs ( TSRs ) , into memory . In DOS , CONFIG.SYS is located in the root directory of the drive from which the system was booted . The filename is also used by ( DCP ) , an MS-DOS derivative by the former East-German VEB Robotron . Some versions of DOS will probe for alternative filenames taking precedence over the default CONFIG.SYS filename if they exist : While older versions of Concurrent DOS 3.2 to 4.1 did not support CONFIG.SYS files at all , later versions of Concurrent DOS 386 and Concurrent DOS XM , as well as Multiuser DOS , System Manager and REAL/32 will probe for CCONFIG.SYS ( with "" C "" derived from "" Concurrent "" ) instead of CONFIG.SYS . Some versions of MultiuserDOS use a filename of CCONFIG.INI instead , whereas REAL/32 is known to look for MCONFIG.SYS . These operating systems support many additional and different configuration settings ( like INIT_INSTALL ) not known under MS-DOS/PCDOS , but they are stored in the binary repository named CCONFIG.BIN rather than in CCONFIG.INI . Since DRDOS6.0 this was used in conjunction with disk compression software , where the original boot driveC : would become driveD : after loading the compression driver ( and the "" D "" in the file name came in handy as well ) , but it is commonly used to help maintain multiple configuration files in multi-boot scenarios . For example , with SYS /L /DR:703 the written Volume Boot Record would look for a renamed and modified IBMBIO.703 system file ( instead of the default IBMBIO.COM ) and the IBMBIO.703 would look for IBMDOS.703 and [D]CONFIG.703 ( instead of IBMDOS.COM and [D]CONFIG.SYS ) , so that multiple parallel sets of files can coexist in the same root directory and be selected via a boot-loader like LOADER , supplied with Multiuser DOS and DR-DOS 7.02/7.03 . The SHELL directive is enhanced to provide means to specify alternative AUTOEXEC.BAT files via /P[:filename.ext] and in this specific scenario , COMMAND.COM will accept file extensions other than "" .BAT "" as well ( both features are also supported by 4DOS ) . Under DRDOS6.0 and higher , the CONFIG.SYS directive CHAIN = filespec can be used to continue processing in the named file , which does not necessarily need to reside in the root directory of the boot drive . DR-DOS 7.03 and higher support a new SYS /A parameter in order to copy the corresponding CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files along with the system files . FreeDOS implements a similar feature with its FDCONFIG.SYS configuration file . PTS-DOS uses CONFIG.PTS . Both CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT can be found included in the root folder of Windows 95 , and Windows 98 boot drives , as they are based on DOS . Windows ME does not even parse the CONFIG.SYS file during the Windows boot process , loading environment variables from the Windows Registry instead : Under FlexOS , CONFIG.SYS is a binary file defining the resource managers and device drivers loaded . ( Under MS-DOS/PCDOS the inline-comment is not ignored if put in double-quotes . ) ( FreeDOS does not support optional messages , but optional conditions in conjunction with boot menus defined with and . ) ( DOS 6.0 and higher supports a similar feature by adding a after the corresponding CONFIG.SYS directive , f.e. Configures which drives should store file access date stamps in the reserved area of directory entries in FAT file systems . Changes internal default serial device driver ( to ) for device . Loads base device driver into memory . Specifies operating system to be booted . Same as , but explicitly loads buffers into HMA or UMB ( like under DR DOS 6.0 and higher ) . Similar to under DOS , loads programs in CONFIG.SYS . Similar to under OS/2 , but runs in foreground and halts CONFIG.SYS processing until return . Specifies the name of the CD-ROM hardware driver . Continues CONFIG.SYS processing in new file and ( since DR-DOS 7.02 ) at optional label . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM1 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM2 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM3 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for COM4 : device . Loads a device driver into memory . Loads a device driver into upper memory . Configures country and codepage information for KBD , SCR , LPT1 , LPT2 , LPT3 devices . Specifies whether to load DOS into the high memory area and/or use upper memory . Specifies whether to load DOS tables ( , , , , ) into upper memory . Specifies alternative path to search for DOS files . Works considerably differently from the external MS-DOS/PCDOS FASTOPEN driver . Specifies the number of cached FCBs that can be opened at once . ( Under DR-DOS , and dynamically share the same internal buffer . ) Same as , but explicitly loads FCBs into upper memory . Waits for key ( or timeout ) and sets error level to its ASCII code ( or 1024 on timeout ) . Installs a TSR program into memory , like , but installs after the DOS data segment relocation . Loads installable file systems . Specifies programs ( which would normally run at the CPU 's IOPL ring 3 ) which should be allowed to run at ring 2 in order to directly access the hardware for I/O . ( Can be emulated using and under DR-DOS . ) ( Same as in DR DOS 5.0 . ) Installs a TSR program into memory , like , but installs after the DOS data segment relocation . Configures boot logo support under MS-DOS . Allows to display startup message in conjunction with PTS-DOS boot manager . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for LPT1 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for LPT2 : device . Defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for LPT3 : device . Enables , defines count and logical order and configures I/O address and timeout for LPT4 : device . Specifies the default DOS memory allocation strategy . ( Can be emulated using under DR-DOS . ) ( Can be emulated using and under DR-DOS . ) ( Can be emulated using and under DR-DOS . ) Continues CONFIG.SYS processing in new file ( similar to DR-DOS CHAIN ) and optionally after loading a specific device driver and setting %NEWFILE% environment variable . Similar to and under DR-DOS , displays a text and waits for a key press . Configures buffer size for LPT1 , LPT2 , LPT3 . Changes internal default printer device driver ( to , or even ) for PRN device . Specifies if DOS programs can be run or not . Conditional execution on PS/1 -compatible machines only . Conditional execution on PS/2 -compatible machines only . Specifies a drive letter not to be used up for local block device drivers . Similar to under DOS and under OS/2 , but loads programs in background concurrently . Specifies , if the first character of deleted files should be stored in the reserved area of directory entries in the FAT file system . Similar to under PTS-DOS , specifies the video mode to be used under FreeDOS . Under PTS-DOS , does not specify the video mode but screen access methods . Same as , but supports an additional parameter to define the size of the pre-allocation for COMMAND.COM to relocate its resident portion into the HMA ( with /MH ) . SHELLHIGH under PTS-DOS tries to load the shell into UMBs instead . ) Specifies the state of the keyboard modifiers like Shift Lock , Num Lock , Scroll Lock or Insert mode . Specifies if POST should be skipped on reboots . Compatibility dummy - DR DOS 3.31 - 6.0 were mostly reentrant and had a different stacks layout . ( Can be emulated using , and under DR-DOS . ) Defines the default SwitChar used by the system ( either ' / ' or ' - ' ) . Specifies file name of alternative DOS operating systems to boot . Configures the location of the various DOS parts in memory . Specifies if DOS data and code should be loaded into UMBs . PTS-DOS only supports the timeout value . The functionality under OS/2 differs significantly from that under DOS . Configures DOS management to use a specific segment as UMB memory . Specifies the DOS version ( and optionally the true DOS version ) to be reported to programs . Similar to under FreeDOS , specifies current video mode . Configures the built-in Year 2000 support . However , this file , along with AUTOEXEC.BAT , is essential for the complete bootup process to occur with the DOS operating system . These files contain information that is used to customize the operating system for personal use . A DOS system would require troubleshooting if either of these files became damaged or corrupted . If CONFIG.SYS does not contain a SHELL directive ( or the file is corrupt or missing ) , DOS typically searches for COMMAND.COM in the root directory of the boot drive . If this is not found , versions of DOS before 6.0 will not start up . MS-DOS 6.0/PCDOS 6.1 and Novell DOS 7 and higher will instead display a prompt to enter the path and filename of a command processor . ( In the case of COMMAND.COM , the internal EXIT command is disabled only when the shell was started with /P . ) This also provides limited means to replace the shell at runtime without having to reboot the system . Since the MS-DOS 7.0 and higher COMMAND.COM executable is incompatible with DR-DOS , but typically resides in the root of drive C : in dual-boot scenarios with DR-DOS , DR-DOS 7.02 and higher no longer allow to bypass SHELL directives in ( + ) // "" skip "" / "" trace "" / "" step "" modes . Also , if no SHELL directive could be found when skipping CONFIG.SYS processing via ( + ) ( and also with ( + ) / , when the default file extension has been changed with SYS /DR:ext ) , the user is prompted to enter a valid shell file name before trying to load COMMAND.COM from the root . Depending on the version , the size of the CONFIG.SYS file is limited to a few kilobytes under MS-DOS/PCDOS ( up to 64KB in most recent versions ) , whereas the file 's size is unlimited under DR-DOS . This is because the former operating systems ( since DOS 3.0 ) will compile the file into some tokenized in-memory representation before they sort and regroup the directives to be processed in a specific order ( with device drivers always being loaded before TSRs ) , whereas DR-DOS interprets the file and executes most directives line-by-line , thereby giving full control over the load order of drivers and TSRs via DEVICE and INSTALL ( for example to solve load order conflicts or to load a program debugger before a device driver to be debugged ) and allowing to adapt the user interaction and change the flow through the file based on conditions like processor types installed , any type of keys pressed , load or input errors occurring , or return codes given by loaded software . This becomes particularly useful since INSTALL can also be used to run non-resident software under DR-DOS , so that temporary external programs can be integrated into the CONFIG.SYS control flow . In MS-DOS/PCDOS 2.0 through 4.01 , the length of the SHELL line was limited to 31 characters , whereas up to 128 characters are possible in later versions . DR-DOS even accepts up to 255 characters . When installing Windows 95 over a preexisting DOS/Windows install , CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are renamed to CONFIG.DOS and AUTOEXEC.DOS . This is intended to ease dual booting between Windows9x and DOS . When booting into DOS , they are temporarily renamed CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT . Backups of the Windows95 versions are made as CONFIG.W40 and AUTOEXEC.W40 files . When Caldera DR-DOS 7.02/7.03 is installed on a system already containing Windows95 , Windows ' CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT retain those names . DR-DOS ' startup files are installed as DCONFIG.SYS ( a name already used in earlier versions of DR DOS ) and AUTODOS7.BAT . OS/2 uses the CONFIG.SYS file extensively for setting up its configuration , drivers and environment before the graphical part of the system loads .",['at runtime'],['Library']
