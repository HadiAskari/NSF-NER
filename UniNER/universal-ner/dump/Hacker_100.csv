"['Effective marketing operations today are driven by the use of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications.

They house essential go-to-market strategies, and are often connected to live payment systems authorized to spend substantial budgets.

In this article, we explore the top Marketing SaaS application use cases, from external users and publicly shared links to connected apps and credit cards — and how to ensure the security and integrity of the data stored within them.', ""Marketing departments frequently grant administrative or high-access permissions to agency and freelance partners who need access to sensitive reports and data in order to perform. However, managing these external users can be a daunting task. It's vital to closely monitor their permissions and trim them down to the minimum necessary level. Additionally, there's often a gap between the time an employee leaves an agency and when the agency notifies the client. During this period, former employees can retain their access."", 'Collaboration with agencies often requires sharing files, project management boards, and folders with various team members. Using one set of public links for all users is a tantalizing option, as it cuts down on administrative tasks every time a new user is introduced into the project.', 'However, this approach can inadvertently expose sensitive assets to former agency employees or other unintended recipients, as public links can be used by anyone.', ""Marketing budgets often involve significant sums of money, and this financial data is highly sensitive. It's not uncommon for external agencies to manage these budgets, and if left unsecured, it could lead to malicious activities like unauthorized data access or the running of negative campaigns.

"['This new product offers SaaS discovery and risk assessment coupled with a free user access review in a unique ""freemium"" model', 'Securing employees\' SaaS usage is becoming increasingly crucial for most cloud-based organizations. While numerous tools are available to address this need, they often employ different approaches and technologies, leading to unnecessary confusion and complexity. Enter Wing Security\'s new ""Essential SSPM"" (SaaS Security Posture Management) tool, which aims to simplify the process of securing SaaS usage across the organization. Its business approach is simple: self-onboard, try the product, and if impressed, upgrade to unlock more vital security capabilities.', 'According to Wing, three basic yet fundamental capabilities are necessary for organizations aiming to secure their SaaS: discovery, assessment, and control. These align with regulatory security standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC, which emphasize vendor and third-party risk assessment programs, as well as controlling user access to critical business tools.', ""Shadow IT is not a novel issue but rather an evolving one. With the continuous increase in SaaS usage and the ability for users to bypass security policies like MFA and SSO when onboarding SaaS applications, the new face of shadow IT is SaaS-based. The process is simple: employees need to complete a business task and often require a tool to facilitate it. They search for a solution online, using company credentials to log in, particularly when most services don't require credit card information to get started. SaaS, being the modern supply chain, clearly requires a security solution due to its decentralized and ungoverned nature."", 'Once the shadow element is resolved, organizations are left with an extensive list of applications, often numbering in the thousands. This begs the question: what now? Without an automated method for evaluating the risks associated with all the SaaS applications linked to the organization, uncovering shadow SaaS can be more confusing and burdensome than helpful. This highlights the importance of assessing the security status of these applications and determining a threshold that requires attention.', ""SaaS discovery must go hand in hand with some degree of vendor or third-party risk assessment. Wing's new product tier combines SaaS discovery with an automated processes for determining an application's SaaS security score. This risk information is extracted from a vast SaaS database of over 280,000 SaaS on record, cross-checked with the data from hundreds of Wing's users and their SaaS environments. Paying customers benefit from broader and deeper SaaS risk assessments, including near-real-time threat intelligence alerts."", 'Discovering all SaaS in use (and not in use) and understanding their risks is only half the battle; the other half involves SaaS users. They grant applications access and permissions to company data, making choices regarding read/write permissions for the numerous applications they use. On average, each employee uses 28 SaaS applications at any given time, which translates to hundreds, if not thousands, of SaaS applications with access to company data.', 'Conducting periodic user access reviews across essential business applications is not just a regulatory requirement but also highly recommended for maintaining a secure posture. Controlling who has access to which application can prevent sensitive data from falling into the wrong hands and significantly reduce the potential attack surface, as employees are often the first targets for malicious actors. A long list of users and their permissions and roles across various applications can be overwhelming, which is why Wing aids in prioritizing users based on their permissions, their roles and by encouraging the least privilege concept. This ensures that all users, except approved admins, have only basic access to SaaS applications.', ""In summary - These three capabilities are essential for starting a proper SaaS security program, but they don't guarantee full coverage or control. Mature security organizations will require more. Data security features, automated remediation paths and more control over user privileges and behaviors are only possible with Wing's full solution. That said, these are an important starting point for those organizations who don't yet have SaaS security in place or are contemplating which tools and approaches to get started with."", 'This new ""try first, pay later"" approach differs from the average POC primarily in its completely no-touch nature. Users can self-onboard the product by agreeing to Wing\'s legal conditions, without the need to interact with a human representative or sales personnel, unless they choose to. While the free product is intentionally limited in features and capabilities, it provides a starting point for those curious about or seeking SaaS security. Unlike online demos, this process involves the actual processing of your data and can genuinely enhance your security posture by providing visibility into your company\'s real SaaS usage and by allowing you to evaluate the magnitude of your SaaS attack surface.

"[""The browser has become the main work interface in modern enterprises. It's where employees create and interact with data, and how they access organizational and external SaaS and web apps. As a result, the browser is extensively targeted by adversaries. They seek to steal the data it stores and use it for malicious access to organizational SaaS apps or the hosting machine. Additionally, unintentional data leakage via the browser has become a critical concern for organizations as well."", 'However, traditional endpoint, network, and data protection solutions fail to protect this critical resource against advanced web-borne attacks that continuously rise in sophistication and volume. This gap leaves organizations exposed to phishing attacks, malicious browser extensions, data exposure, and data loss.', 'This is the challenge LayerX is attempting to solve. LayerX has developed a secure enterprise browser extension that can be mounted on any browser. The LayerX extension delivers comprehensive visibility, continuous monitoring, and granular policy enforcement on every event within the browsing session. Using proprietary Deep Session Analysis technology, LayerX can mitigate browser data loss risks, prevent credential theft by phishing sites, identify malicious extensions, and much more.', ""In this platform review, we'll walk you through the entire LayerX user journey, from initial installation and configuration to visibility and protection. (to get a personalized demo of Layerx, visit their website here)"", ""LayerX is designed for easy installation on top of the organization's existing browser infrastructure. The user can distribute it through a group policy, any enterprise device management platform, or the browser's management workspace. For the last option, LayerX is not installed on the hosting device. Instead, it is delivered as part of the browser's profile, making it a natural choice for the protection of unmanaged devices. The installation screen enabled the user to choose the browsers that are in use in their environment."", 'Once the installation is complete, the LayerX dashboard immediately becomes populated with pre-defined policies, information on the browsers, users, extensions, and web activity. When the user configures policies, the dashboard will show them as well, along with their status, detected risk alerts, and other data aggregations.', ""The dashboard provides high-level insights into the security posture of the browser ecosystem.

Any violation of the conditions defined in the policy will trigger the configured protection, as well an alert that notifies the admin of the violation and its details:', ""Another critical issue LayerX policies enable resolving is Shadow Identity. This risk surfaces mainly within sanctioned apps. Suppose the user's organization is using Google Suite, with employees accessing it with a corporate identity. However, they also have a personal Google account that introduces a data leakage risk if an employee accidentally uploads files with sensitive data to their personal drive or email rather than to the corporate one."", ""To solve this challenge, LayerX enables users to configure policies that are sensitive to the employee's identity and add the identity as a condition, together with file content, labeling, and other traditional DLP attributes. Once enabled, the policy prevents uploading of corporate data to Google, unless it's accessed by the user's corporate account."", ""LayerX can be integrated with the environment's cloud Identity Provider (IdP). In that manner, access to the SaaS apps the IDP manages is possible only from a browser on which the extension is installed. For example, when accessing a SaaS app via Okta without LayerX on the browser, an alert message is triggered:"", ""LayerX serves here as an MFA, but without the intrusive user experience of the push notification to the employee's phone. This serves as extremely effective mitigation against malicious access that exploits compromised credentials, since adversaries will never get access to SaaS and web resources based on credentials alone."", 'The final LayerX screen in this overview is the Alerts screen. Every triggered policy registers an alert. The Alerts screen classifies and aggregates the alert by severity (low, medium, high, critical) and type (paste, safe browsing, etc.), and shows the top triggered policies.', 'The user can use the various filters to view only alerts within a certain timeframe, type, action type, or risk level.', ""For example, filtering for the 'Upload' type will show all the policies that were triggered by employees who uploaded files in an insecure manner. Clicking on 'Investigate' reveals the employees' browsing trail and the exact point within the session that violated the policy."", ""For example, the following event journey for a data upload policy shows that the employee uploaded a file to their personal Gmail and then switched back to their work account.

With customizable templates and a user-friendly interface, it's the ultimate solution for pentest teams looking to elevate their performance and achieve exceptional results."", ""In this quick walkthrough, we highlight the advantages that make one pen test tool a valuable ally. PentestPad helps navigate through blockers and boundaries, scheduled pen tests, vulnerability reports, retests and much more, so let's take a look:"", 'Make sure everything stays within the scope and time boundaries. Very often, especially when working in different time zones – pen testers will have to calculate what the current time for their client is, what is restricted from scope, etc. We make it very easy for them. When a project is created, out-of-scope IP or URL is specified and if needed, time boundaries are set. If a request is sent that interferes with those boundaries, the tool will alert you and reject any such traffic. If needed, the restrictions can always be changed or bypassed with adequate roles.', 'The main page for project managers is a customizable Kanban board to fit your custom workflow. All project statuses are customizable to adapt your workflow.', 'However, there are a few elements that contribute to the learning curve. Once conquered, they will increase your productivity. Just by looking at one screen, you can grasp the stage and status of all projects across your team.', 'Besides the kanban board that is used for project management, a calendar view is also available. Here, you can view all projects, parallel assignments, meetings, and also sick leave as well as other events that are an important aspect of managing the workload.', 'Activity logging is a feature that monitors HTTP traffic generated by pen testers and detects various behaviors. For example - if there are lots of HTTP requests sent to the same endpoint with slightly modified request body, the activity logger will detect and tag it as a brute force attack. This feature helps understand what caused downtime, or what resulted in a successful exploit of a vulnerability.', 'Another useful example would be working on a website full of JavaScript alerts. Amongst hundreds of payloads injected in the comments section by Burp scanner, the activity logger can very easily detect which request actually caused it.', 'Performance monitoring is something that is hard to track unless you monitor all aspects of a pen test, and that is exactly what this feature does. It is a version of a traffic monitoring tool combined with utilizing key information such as findings and their impact/criticality. For example, this feature can be used to view how many projects a person is working on, how many findings they discovered, average criticality per finding, how many tasks they completed and their average findings per project.', 'This feature is the heart of PentestPad because it automates one of the most time-consuming tasks that is ultimately the only proof of a pen test. No more formatting issues, no more mixing tools, and no more sending vulnerability descriptions back and forth. PentestPad allows you to write project unique vulnerability information and just generate a report in a predefined, fully customizable template.', 'The tool auto generates PDF and DOCX from your templates and ready executive summaries based on project findings.', 'Another great feature is the semi auto retest functionality. With the help of AI-model, this feature will automatically detect if a previously discovered vulnerability is still present. Realistically, there are certain business logic vulnerabilities that will require human interaction. However, for common findings such as CSRF or XSS, the Retest functionality will have it handled.', 'The tool fully supports white-labeling for reports, and gives customers the option to choose between cloud or on-premise implementation.
