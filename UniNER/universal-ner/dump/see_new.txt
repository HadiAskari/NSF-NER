It has since claimed five victims to date.\', \'The threat actors behind it, however, have sought to dispel these speculations, stating that it purchased the Hive source code and website from its developers.\', \'"The group appears to place a greater emphasis on data exfiltration," Zugec said. "Notably, all reported victims had data exfiltrated, but not all of them had their data encrypted," making Hunters International more of a data extortion outfit.\', "Bitdefender\'s analysis of the ransomware sample reveals its Rust-based foundations, a fact borne out by Hive\'s transition to the programming language in July 2022 for its increased resistance to reverse engineering.", \'"In general, as the new group adopts this ransomware code, it appears that they have aimed for simplification," Zugec said.\', \'"They have reduced the number of command line parameters, streamlined the encryption key storage process, and made the malware less verbose compared to earlier versions."\', \'The ransomware, besides incorporating an exclusion list of file extensions, file names, and directories to be omitted from encryption, runs commands to prevent data recovery as well as terminate a number of processes that could potentially interfere with the process.\', \'"While Hive has been one of the most dangerous ransomware groups, it remains to be seen if Hunters International will prove equally or even more formidable," Zugec noted.\', \'"This group emerges as a new threat actor starting with a mature toolkit and appears eager to show its capabilities, [but] faces the task of demonstrating its competence before it can attract high-caliber affiliates."\', \'Sign up for free and start receiving your daily dose of cybersecurity news, insights and tips.\'].
